Description:

This plugin is a multiplayer version of the singleplayer version of SkyBlock which contains two different game modes:
(1) PvP mode, where each player has one life and island
(2) build mode with endless lifes

The plugin creates an empty minecraft world additional to your existing worlds. The default world name "SkyblockMultiplayer" can be changed within the supplied config file if necessary.
Initially only an out-look tower is created, which can be accessed via console command "/skyblock join". With the command "/skyblock start" the player gets a new island.
The distance between the islands can be changed within the config file.

New languages for the game messages can be added as .yml files to the language folder. As basis for the translation the default english.yml is provided in the folder.
Additional translation files can be downloaded from the github repository (languages.tar) and added to the language folder.

Copy the SkyblockMultiplayer.jar into your plugin folder
