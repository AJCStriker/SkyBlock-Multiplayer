Description:

This plugin is a multiplayer version of the singleplayer version of SkyBlock which contains two different game modes:
(1) PvP mode, where each player can have a defined finite number of islands or lives
(2) build mode with endless lifes

The plugin creates an empty minecraft world with the name "SkyBlockMultiplayer" additional to your existing worlds.
Initially only an out-look tower is created, which can be accessed via console command "/skyblock join". With the command "/skyblock start" the player gets a new island.
The distance between the islands can be changed within the config file.


New languages for the game messages can be added as .yml files to the language folder. A number of languages (only default english and german at the moment) are provided in the zip subfolder "language_translations".
These files can be copied into the folder SkyBlockMultiplayer/languages and can also be used as basis for new tranlations. To load a new language file use the command "/skyblock set language <language>".


How to install the plugin:
Copy the SkyBlockMultiplayer.jar into your plugin folder
Start the server, the plugin creates a folder named SkyBlockMultiplayer, this folder contains the config file and the language folder with the default english.yml

Important for Multiverse users:
To import the world within multiverse use: /mv import SkyBlockMultiplayer normal -g SkyBlockMultiplayer
At the moment there is an issue regarding the chunkgenerator that creates the empty world for this plugin. 
In multiverse the generator can potentially be overwritten by multiverse and original minecraft chunks are generated. 
If this happens, please use the CleanRoomGenerator instead: /mv import SkyBlockMultiplayer normal -g CleanRoomGenerator
