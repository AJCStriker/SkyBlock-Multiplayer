Description:

This plugin is a multiplayer version of the singleplayer version of SkyBlock which contains two different game modes:
(1) PvP mode, where each player has one life and island
(2) build mode with endless lifes

The plugin creates an empty minecraft world with the name "SkyBlockMultiplayer" additional to your existing worlds.
Initially only an out-look tower is created, which can be accessed via console command "/skyblock join". With the command "/skyblock start" the player gets a new island.
The distance between the islands can be changed within the config file.


New languages for the game messages can be added as .yml files to the language folder. A number of languages (only default english and german at the moment) are provided in the zip subfolder "language_translations".
These files can be copied into the folder SkyBlockMultiplayer/languages and can also be used as basis for new tranlations. To load a new language file use the command "/skyblock set language <language>".
